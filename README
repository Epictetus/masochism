Connection proxy sends some queries (those in a transaction, update statements,
and ActiveRecord::Base#reload) to a master database, and the rest to the slave
database.  The ActiveReload::MasterDatabase model uses a 'master_database'
setting in database.yml to serve as the master database.  

To setup:

Whether you want this in production only, or maybe just your deployment server, 
is up to you.  Just call this method somewhere:

  ActiveReload::ConnectionProxy.setup!

Some suggestions:

  * in a config/initializer
  * config.after_initialize block

If you want a model to always use the Master database, you can inherit 
ActiveRelaod::MasterDatabase.  Any models with their own database connection
will not be affected.

Setting up your own proxies:

  # Sets up MyMaster's connection as the master database connection for User.
  ActiveReload::ConnectionProxy.setup_for MyMaster, User
